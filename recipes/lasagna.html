    <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook the Sausage, Ground Beef, Onion, and Garlic in the oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Crushed Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce, Tomato Paste, and Water. Season with Sugar, 2 tbs Parsley & Basil. 1 tsp Salt, Italian Seasoning, Fennel Seeds, and Pepper. Simmar, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Boil a large pot of lightly salted Water. Cook the Lasagna Noodles for 8-10 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>Combine Ricotta Cheese with Egg, & the remaining 2 tbs parsely, and 1/2 tsp of salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Then let it rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
